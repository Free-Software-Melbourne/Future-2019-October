## What happened?
<hr />

- Marvin Minsky shown to be on Epstein list on August 9 (2019?)
- Stallman emails public list on about September 13 2019
- About the definition of "sexual assault", and "rape"
- From a student: "when this email chain inevitably finds its way into the press, the seeming insensitivity of some will reflect poorly on the entire CSAIL community"
- Emails "leaked" recently (it was a department wide mailing list including many students)
- Resigned from FSF and MIT on September 16 (not GNU)
- Stallmans homepage defaced: message which he said he had stepped down from GNU (just two days after saying the exact opposite).

## Reactions
<hr />

- Stallman: "many people now believe I defended him — and other inaccurate claims — and feel a real hurt because of what they believe I said. I'm sorry for that hurt.  I wish I could have prevented the misunderstanding"
- "He’s responsible for relying too much on people’s careful reading of his note"
- "His intentions do not matter nearly as much as his actions and their predictable effects"
- "... Eighteen GNU Project maintainers argue otherwise"
- "Why do we ponder the low enrollment of female and minority graduate students at MIT with one hand and endorse shitty men in science with the other"
